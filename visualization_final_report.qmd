## Instructions

<p><b>What you should do:</b></p>
- Follow best practices as you’ve learned in the class to produce and fine tune a data visualization.

<p><b>What you should tell me:</b> <i>Some things which should be included, but not a checklist...</i></p>

- What data you’re plotting, and what its source is.

- Are there any sources of inspiration you’re pulling from?

- Do you have a sketch of what you’d *like* the plot to look like?

- What *decisions* did you make in creating the plot (e.g. labels,
  colors, geometries, plot orientation, etc.)

- Why did you make those decisions?

- Does the final plot fall short of your ultimate vision in any way?
